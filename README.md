# 4G-LTE-IMSI-Catcher-Detector
Passive 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / 4G LTE IMSI Detector WIKI Environment for Security Companies and Agencies


Within this repository we will manage our 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector Wiki page where we will manage and explain the add-ons specifically for the Internal and External Theft and Security Sector.

We use the X-Surveillance 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector for which we have developed specific Add-Ons for Security Companies that specialize in preventing and minimizing Internal and External Theft.

The add-ons for the X-Surveillance 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector will be added here and described within the Wiki page.

It is important to know that we only provide passive and close proximity IMSI detection which means that we never intercept data from the suspect. Don't come to us for that either, that's not what we will do, never will do.

Do you want a 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector that can help you against Internal and External Theft then we can help you with this. Our Add-Ons on the 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector ensure that you receive NATIVE (without downgrade or jamming) the TMSI and IMSI from the suspicious device.

With our Add-Ons on the 4G LTE IMSI Catcher / Detector, the user gets the TMSI and IMSI of all types of devices such as smartphones, tablets, vehicles, GPS trackers, infotainment, ecall systems and so on natively within the 4G LTE protocol.

The Add-Ons will be made available open source on X-Surveillance's proprietary technology. If you want to know more about this 4G LTE IMSI Detector technology let us know.
